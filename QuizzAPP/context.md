Contribution: 100% of the grade
Module leader: Konstantin Kapinchev Due date: 12 Aug 2025
Approximate time to complete the coursework: 50 hours
Learning outcomes:
1. Demonstrate detailed understanding of established industrial standards by writing
   software requirements specifications for object-oriented, data-driven and interactive
   applications.
2. Design object-oriented, data-driven and interactive applications by using UML.
3. Develop and test object-oriented, data-driven and interactive applications by applying
   object-oriented principles, such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and
   polymorphism.
4. Apply advanced object-oriented techniques to develop advanced software solutions,
   which solve real-world problems.
   Plagiarism is presenting somebody else’s work as one's own. It includes copying information
   directly from online resources or books without referencing the material, submitting joint
   coursework as an individual effort; copying another student’s coursework, purchasing
   coursework from someone else and submitting it as own work. Suspected plagiarism will be
   investigated and if found to have occurred will be dealt with according to the procedures set
   by the University. All material copied or amended from any source must be referenced
   correctly according to specific reference style. Courseworks will be submitted for electronic
   plagiarism checks.
   Coursework Submission Requirements:
- An electronic copy of the coursework is expected to be submitted on Moodle before the
  deadline
- Submit Part 1 as a single C# source code file (.cs)
- Submit both Part 2 and Part 3 as a single PDF file
- The last uploaded version will be the one that is marked
- The limit of the file size is 100 MB
- The submitted documents should be virus-free, not protected by a password or corrupted
- The source code needs to be selectable text, otherwise it will not be marked
- The coursework grade and feedback will be available on Moodle
  The University website has details of the current Coursework Regulations, including details of
  penalties for late submission, procedures for Extenuating Circumstances, and penalties for
  Assessment Offences. See https://www.gre.ac.uk/student-services/regulations-and-policies for
  details.2
  Use of AI
  In case AI-generated content is included in the coursework, it needs to be enclosed in
  quotation marks and properly referenced. This applies to both text and source code.
  Otherwise, if detected, it may be considered plagiarism.
  Coursework Specification:
  Part 1
  Develop text-based quiz game on the topic of Geography. Implement the game as a C#,
  Windows-based WinForm application. The game is expected to include three types of
  questions:
1. Multiple choice questions. In this case, four possible answers are provided for the
   user to choose from. Only one of the four possible answers is correct.
2. Open-ended questions. In this case, the user is expected to enter the answer. The
   answer is expected to have one to four words. Some correct answers can be expressed
   differently, for example United Kingdom and UK. Allow the program to accept correct answers
   which are phrased differently.
3. True or false questions. In this case, a statement will be displayed, which the user
   will indicate as correct (true) or incorrect (false).
   Mode 1: Create a game
   In this mode, the user will be able to add questions and their corresponding answers. The game
   is expected to be able to store variable number of questions. The questions are expected to be
   organised as objects and stored in data structures, which maintain variable number of elements.
   Since the game is not expected to store questions in a file or database, every restart of the game
   will clear all previously entered data. Additionally, the user is expected to be able to delete and
   edit selected questions without restarting the game.
   Mode 2: Play
   In this mode, the user will answer the questions. After answering the last question, the game is
   expected to display the result (score) of the game as number of correctly answered questions.
   Also, the game is expected to display the time, in minutes, which was spent on answering all
   questions. Additionally, if requested, the game is expected to display the correct answers to all
   questions. The game is expected to provide a choice to the user either to start again from the
   beginning, or to exit the program.
   Organise each question and its corresponding answer in a separate object. Utilise the
   object-oriented principles of encapsulation, abstraction and inheritance. Store all objects
   in linear data structures, which maintain variable number of elements.3
   Part 2
   Based on the quiz game program developed in Part 1, write a software requirements
   specification of maximum 500 words. The software requirements specification is expected to
   have the following content:
1. Introduction
- Purpose
- Project scope
2. Overall Description
- Product
- Users
- Operational Environment
3. System Features
- Description
- Functional Requirements
4. User Interface Requirements
5. Platform Requirements
6. Quality Attributes
- Performance
- Security
- Safety
  For more information about writing software requirements specification, refer to:
  Wiegers, Beatty, “Software Requirements”, Third Edition, Microsoft:
  Chapter 10 Documenting the Requirements, page 181
  Chapter 11 Writing Excellent Requirements, page 203
  Part 3
  Provide the following UML diagrams, which represent the design of the program developed
  in Part 1:
- Class Diagram
- Use Case Diagram
  Add captions describing the diagrams.
  For more information about UML, refer to Patrick Grassle “UML 2.0 in Action”.4
  Grading criteria
  70-100% All requirements completed to an excellent standard.
  60-69% All requirements completed. However, there are a number of minor deficiencies in
  significant areas.
  50-59% All requirements completed. However, significant improvements could be made in
  many areas.
  40-49% All requirements completed. However, significant improvements could be made in
  all areas.
  30-39% All requirements attempted but the overall level of understanding and performance is
  poor.
  0-29% There are requirements missing or completed to a very inadequate standard, which
  indicates a very poor or non-existent level of understanding.5
