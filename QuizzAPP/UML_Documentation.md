# UML Documentation - Geography Quiz Game

## Project Overview
The Geography Quiz Game is a comprehensive Windows Forms application developed in C# that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles through a fully functional quiz system. The application features Material Design UI components for a modern, minimalist interface and implements all required coursework specifications.

## Architecture Summary

### **Core Technologies**
- **.NET 9.0** with Windows Forms
- **MaterialSkin.NET** for Material Design UI
- **Object-Oriented Design** with inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction
- **In-memory data storage** using generic collections

### **Key Features Implemented**
- ✅ **Three Question Types**: Multiple Choice, Open Ended, True/False
- ✅ **Two Game Modes**: Create Game (question management) and Play Game (quiz execution)
- ✅ **OOP Principles**: Abstract base class, inheritance hierarchy, encapsulation
- ✅ **Advanced Features**: Alternative answers, time tracking, comprehensive scoring
- ✅ **Material Design UI**: Modern, responsive interface with consistent theming
- ✅ **Sample Data**: 18 pre-loaded geography questions for immediate testing

## UML Diagrams

### 1. Class Diagram
**File**: `UML_ClassDiagram.md`

The class diagram illustrates the complete object-oriented architecture of the application, showing:

#### **Core Class Hierarchy**
```
Question (Abstract Base Class)
├── MultipleChoiceQuestion
├── OpenEndedQuestion
└── TrueFalseQuestion
```

#### **Key Design Patterns**
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Question creation through inheritance
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven updates in QuizManager
- **Composition Pattern**: Complex objects built from simpler components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose

#### **OOP Principles Demonstrated**
- **Inheritance**: Question hierarchy with specialized implementations
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public property accessors
- **Abstraction**: Abstract Question class with virtual/abstract methods
- **Polymorphism**: Different IsAnswerCorrect() implementations per question type

#### **Manager Classes**
- **QuizManager**: Handles CRUD operations for questions
- **ScoreCalculator**: Manages scoring, grading, and performance analysis
- **TimeTracker**: Tracks quiz timing with precision timing capabilities

#### **UI Architecture**
- **MaterialForm-based**: All forms inherit from MaterialForm for consistent theming
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separated from business logic
- **Event-Driven**: User interactions handled through event handlers

### 2. Use Case Diagram
**File**: `UML_UseCaseDiagram.md`

The use case diagram captures all functional requirements and user interactions:

#### **Primary Actor**
- **User**: The person using the geography quiz application

#### **Main Use Case Categories**

**Mode 1: Create Game (Question Management)**
- Add New Question (UC1)
- Edit Existing Question (UC2)
- Delete Question (UC3)
- View Question List (UC4)
- Preview Question (UC5)
- Clear All Questions (UC6)
- Load Sample Quiz (UC7)

**Mode 2: Play Game (Quiz Execution)**
- Start Quiz (UC9)
- Answer Questions by Type (UC10-UC12)
- Submit Answer (UC13)
- View Progress (UC14)
- Track Time (UC15)
- Calculate Score (UC16)
- View Results (UC17)
- Performance Analysis (UC18)

**Question Type Management**
- Create Multiple Choice Question (UC24)
- Create Open Ended Question (UC25)
- Create True/False Question (UC26)
- Set Alternative Answers (UC27)

#### **Relationship Types**
- **Include**: Mandatory sub-processes (validation, timing, scoring)
- **Extend**: Optional extensions (preview, exit, sample loading)
- **Generalization**: Specialized question answering behaviors

## Implementation Highlights

### **Object-Oriented Excellence**
1. **Abstract Base Class**: `Question` provides common interface and shared functionality
2. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Three concrete question types with specialized behavior
3. **Encapsulation**: All data access through properties with validation
4. **Polymorphism**: Runtime method resolution for question-specific operations

### **Design Patterns Applied**
1. **Template Method**: Question validation and display patterns
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different answer validation strategies per question type
3. **Observer Pattern**: Event notifications for question changes
4. **Factory Method**: Question creation based on type selection

### **Advanced Features**
1. **Alternative Answers**: Support for multiple correct answer formats (e.g., "UK" and "United Kingdom")
2. **Comprehensive Timing**: Both overall quiz time and per-question timing
3. **Detailed Scoring**: Grade calculation, performance breakdown by question type
4. **Input Validation**: Robust validation with user-friendly error messages
5. **Material Design**: Modern UI with consistent theming and responsive layout

### **Data Management**
1. **In-Memory Storage**: Uses `List<Question>` as required by coursework
2. **Generic Collections**: Type-safe collections throughout the application
3. **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time UI updates when data changes
4. **Sample Data Loading**: Pre-configured geography questions for testing
